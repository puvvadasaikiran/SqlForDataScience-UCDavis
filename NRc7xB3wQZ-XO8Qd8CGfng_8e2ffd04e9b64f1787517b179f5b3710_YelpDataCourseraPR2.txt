Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

// Example : SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM table_name;
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (key : id, key_type : primary)
ii. Hours = 1562 (key : business_id, key_type : foreign)
iii. Category = 2643 (key : business_id, key_type : foreign)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (key : business_id, key_type : foreign)
v. Review = 10000 (key : id, key_type : primary)
vi. Checkin = 493 (key : business_id, key_type : foreign)
vii. Photo = 10000 (key : id, key_type : primary)
viii. Tip = 537 (key : user_id, key_type : foreign)
ix. User = 10000 (key : id, key_type : primary)
x. Friend = 11 (key : user_id, key_type : foreign)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (key : user_id, key_type : foreign)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

// Example : SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key)) AS total_distinct_records FROM table_name;


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no.
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user 
		WHERE 
		id IS NULL OR

	SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT name, review_count FROM user ORDER BY review_count DESC LIMIT 3;
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		+--------+--------------+
		| name   | review_count |
		+--------+--------------+
		| Gerald |         2000 |
		| Sara   |         1629 |
		| Yuri   |         1339 |
		+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		No, They are not perfectly correlated coz Amy with Highest number of fans(503) have made just 609 reviews, and Gerald with 2000 reviews have just 253 fans
		We can also observe that only small part of people with high fan count have posted too many reviews
		Many users with high fan count are conservative with number of reviews they have posted
		Number of Fans might be key performance metric for Quality over Quantity.

	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes, more reviews with the word "love" (1780)

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT count(*) As love_count from review where text like '%love%';
	SELECT count(*) As hate_count from review where text like '%hate%';


	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer: SELECT name, fans from user ORDER BY fans DESC LIMIT 10;
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		+-----------+------+
		| name      | fans |
		+-----------+------+
		| Amy       |  503 |
		| Mimi      |  497 |
		| Harald    |  311 |
		| Gerald    |  253 |
		| Christine |  173 |
		| Lisa      |  159 |
		| Cat       |  133 |
		| William   |  126 |
		| Fran      |  124 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	City - Mesu


i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	Yes, Places with Higher Ratings have Higher Number of Reviews
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	No, For the Selected Location The neighborhood details are missing

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT k.cat,k.name,k.id, k.neighborhood,k.city,k.stars,k.review_count,k.is_open, Count(*) AS Days_of_open 
FROM 
(select 'Rating 2-3' as cat,b.name,b.id, b.neighborhood,b.city,b.stars,b.review_count,b.is_open from 
business b JOIN category h ON h.business_id = b.id WHERE b.city='Mesa' AND b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 UNION   
select 'Rating 4-5' as cat,b.name,b.id, b.neighborhood,b.city,b.stars,b.review_count,b.is_open from business b 
JOIN category h ON h.business_id = b.id WHERE b.city='Mesa' AND b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 ) k

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
	Low rating Business are highly likely to be closed
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
	Open Business have More ratings
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	Predicting if the business is open based on ratings and reviews
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
	We can analyse the Text Data of reviews provided using Word2Vec to know how positive and negative thee reviews, we can analyse them as well as corelate them with 
	rating to predict if business is open or not.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

|                        |       |              | One of my favorite things about this place is every time I have made a reservation I have always got seated almost exactly on time.  This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |

| --9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw |   4.0 |         1389 | Was excited to go here since it was Emerille's Steakhouse.  We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       1 |

|                        |       |              | I ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         |

|                        |       |              | I'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |         |

|                        |       |              | The highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |

The salads and sides (asparagus, potatoes) were excellent. They also have a fine wine selection. This place takes steak on another level!

One nice thing that they did was they did not have enough plantains for both of our plates. So, they gave me my portion and put two on my friend's plate so they could get the meals out. They then brought a side plate with the rest of the plantains when they were finished. It was a well thought out move on the part of the staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         |

| -050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ |   4.0 |          700 | This place is awesome!!!  I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       0 |

They give a lot of french fries so we didn't need to order two entrees with fries but instead ordered one entree with fries and added additional chicken pieces and it was enough to feed three of us.  It's a cheap meal located in a residential neighborhood.  Definitely off the beaten path for us tourist.  The nata was ok.  It would have tasted better if they served it warm or at least at room temp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       1 |

Saturday morning, I was the only one in line. For 10 minutes while a teller conversed with a customer about their grandkids. I get it you want to connect with your customers. Another person working the drive thru  came to the front where I thought he would help me. No such luck. Finally, a woman from the back came out and asked if I had a check deposit or a payment. She finally took my payment. One more reason to hate the big banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       1 |

It wasn't apparent when we picked the car up but by the time we returned the vehicle days later the crack was over 12 inches long.  I explained the situation and Alamo did not charge us anything which we really appreciate!!!  It wasn't our fault to begin with but I don't think all companies would have believed us!

Husband thought his sandwich was ok, priced right but nothing special.  The hit of this place, as many have said, is the homemade pies!  Save room for a slice, very tasty!

The ceviche was tasty, but almost too chunky so it was hard to scoop on a chip. No televisions, so that can be good or bad depending on if you want to watch a game while eating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       1 |
| -7H-oXvCxJzuT42ky6Db0g |   3.5 |          436 | The food here is always delicious. However, the bar staff seemed unhappy and was extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming. My co-worker and I went here on a Sunday night. We both work at a bar in the North Shore that experienced an extremely busy July 4th weekend and we were exhausted and in the search of a good meal. It was impossible to get a smile from a single employee in the building. I ordered the Rhuby drink. The first one was delicious, but the second round was much sweeter and I couldnt finish it. The Shroom flat bread was amazing. My chicken sandwich and buffalo mac & cheese was great. My friend's turkey sandwich and truffle fries were also good. But the lack of friendly or attentive service or even a simple smile was disappointing. The bar was not very busy and the half the restaurant was closed. As workers in the same industry, my friend and I are very aware and understanding of the stress of working in a bar. But I couldn't even bring myself to tip as well as I normally would because the experience was so bad. |       1 |
| -7H-oXvCxJzuT42ky6Db0g |   3.5 |          436 | Came here on a Sunday for lunch. We ordered the candied bacon, pot roast fries, a president salad (which was just a chicken Caesar salad) and the model turkey sandwich. Candied bacon was good, I liked the flavor a lot, not too sweet. The fries were very good as well - they gave a generous portion of the pot roast. The two main meals were ok.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       1 |

| -7PX_FOoCwktlunImRyZdg |   4.0 |           93 | I've been there twice so far probably the best gourmet style pizza place in Pittsburgh. There was not a lot of seating in the restaurant however it seems like there was enough room to add at least 5 more tables. I feel like they are not utilizing the space to its fullist potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       1 |
